# FlagComparison
[FlagMash](https://flagcomparison.web.app)
The website features two main pages: the first displays the rankings of various flags, while the second allows users to compare flags by selecting the one that looks the best. Flag scores are calculated using the ELO rating system, commonly used in chess.
The website uses Firebase as the backend.
